title: PyExplainer: Explaining the Predictions of Just-In-Time Defect Models
categories: [XAI4SE]
excerpt: Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction (i.e., an AI/ML model to predict defect-introducing commits) is proposed to help developers prioritize their limited Software Quality Assurance (SQA) resources on the most risky commits. However, the explainability of JIT defect models remains largely unexplored (i.e., practitioners still do not know why a commit is predicted as defect-introducing). Recently, LIME has been used to generate explanations for any AI/ML models. However, the random perturbation approach used by LIME to generate synthetic neighbors is still suboptimal, i.e., generating synthetic neighbors that may not be similar to an instance to be explained, producing low accuracy of the local models, leading to inaccurate explanations for just-in-time defect models. In this paper, we propose PyExplainerâ€”i.e., a local rule-based model-agnostic technique for generating explanations (i.e., why a commit is predicted as defective) of JIT defect models. Through a case study of two open-source software projects, we find that our PyExplainer produces (1) synthetic neighbors that are 41%-45% more similar to an instance to be explained; (2) 18%-38% more accurate local models; and (3) explanations that are 69%-98% more unique and 17%-54% more consistent with the actual characteristics of defect-introducing commits in the future than LIME (a state-ofthe-art model-agnostic technique). This could help practitioners focus on the most important aspects of the commits to mitigate the risk of being defect-introducing. Thus, the contributions of this paper build an important step towards Explainable AI for Software Engineering, making software analytics more explainable and actionable. Finally, we publish our PyExplainer as a Python package to support practitioners and researchers (https://github.com/awsm-research/PyExplainer).

In graphic design, a pull quote (also known as a lift-out pull quote) is a key phrase, quotation, or excerpt that has been pulled from an article and used as a page layout graphic element, serving to entice readers into the article or to highlight a key topic. {% include pullquote.html quote="It is typically placed in a larger or distinctive typeface and on the same page." %} Pull quotes are often used in magazine and newspaper articles, annual reports, and brochures, as well as on the web. They can add visual interest to text-heavy pages with few images or illustrations.

Placement of a pull quote on a page may be defined in a publication's or website's style guide. Such a typographic device may or may not be aligned with a column on the page. Some designers, for example, choose not to align the quote. In that case, the quotation cuts into two or more columns, as in the example shown. Because the pull quote invites the reader to read about the highlighted material, the pull quote should appear before the text it cites and, generally, fairly close to it.

Pull quotes need not be a verbatim copy of the text being quoted; depending on a publication's house style, pull quotes may be abbreviated for space or paraphrased for clarity, with or without indication.

A disadvantage of pull quotes as a design element is that they can disrupt the reading process of readers invested in reading the text sequentially by drawing attention to ghost fragments out of context. At the other extreme, when pull quotes are used to break up what would otherwise be a formless wall of text, pull quote can serve as visual landmarks to help the reader maintain a sense of sequence and place.
